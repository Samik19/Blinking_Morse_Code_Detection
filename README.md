# Blinking_Morse_Code_Detection

This project seeks to help people with permanent disabilities communicate better. Many people who have lost control of most body parts can still intentionally blink. This blinking can be timed and used as mechnism to communicate. 

This project uses a simple code of blink detection and records the time stamp of the event of detection and uses it to translate to dots or dashes of the morse code. 
In this I've used only 4 combinations of .'s and -'s to represent 4 different messages. You can use it to make your own messages

Happy Blinking! 
Cheers!
